This project consist of a few different data structues that
have been implemented using java. My goal was to learn more
about java generics and gain a solid understanding of basic
data structures. I also wanted these structues to be flexible
and efficient. I will add more structues as I get time. 

Currently contains
    - LinkedList
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Binary Tree
